__Spotify__ is a powerful audio streaming service.

And __Spotify AutoPlaylist__ is a script that automatically selects songs similar to your favorite song on Spotify and automatically puts them in a new playlist.

## How to use
1. API Configuration
   - You need to set up your API token.
   - `client_id = XXXXXX` and `client_secret = XXXXXX` 
   - In my case, I created an .env file and put the necessary information there.
   - And using `dotenv`, I loaded the necessary information.
2. Install necessary libraries
   - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Under construction
